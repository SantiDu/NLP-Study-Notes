# NLP-Study-Notes

I have been learning NLP and have decided to put my study notes here. The 'notes' contains materials that make me feel new or important, plus questions raised during the study and extra readings that answer these questions. I mainly study from an online NLP course taught in Chinese, but also use other materials, e.g. Speech and Language Processing, Mathematical Methods and Algorithms for Signal Processing, Convex Optimization. I'll try to write clear English but please note that it is not my mother tongue.
